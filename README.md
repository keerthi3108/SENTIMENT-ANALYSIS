# Sentiment Analysis using NLP 
## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data such as reviews or tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It identifies whether text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The analysis includes data cleaning, text preprocessing, model implementation, and insight visualization.
Developed as part of the CodTech Internship Program, this notebook demonstrates practical applications of NLP for real-world data interpretation.

## Features
Cleans and preprocesses raw text (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).
Uses the VADER sentiment model from NLTK for accurate polarity scoring.
Categorizes text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment classes.
Visualizes results using bar charts and word clouds.
Runs seamlessly in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

## Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: NLTK, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter

Setup and Execution
Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Install required packages by running:

## python
!pip install pandas nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
Execute all cells to preprocess data, compute sentiment scores, and display insights.

If you encounter an NLTK tokenization error, make sure to include:

python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
Workflow
Data Loading: Import or define your dataset (tweets, reviews, etc.).

Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text using tokenization and lemmatization.

Modeling: Apply NLTK’s VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer.

Visualization: Generate sentiment distribution plots and word clouds.

Insights: Compute overall sentiment trend and summary statistics.

Example Output
Positive Reviews: green distribution bar in chart.

Negative Reviews: highlighted words in black background word cloud.

Insights: overall sentiment score summary.

Results
Provides quick and accurate evaluation of sentiment in text data.

Useful for business analytics, product feedback, and social media monitoring.

Demonstrates valuable skills in data preprocessing, NLP workflow, and data storytelling.

Deliverable
A self-contained notebook showcasing sentiment analysis capabilities, meeting CodTech internship requirements.
